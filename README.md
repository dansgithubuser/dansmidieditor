# Dan's MIDI Editor

Dan's MIDI Editor has a few goals:
- an experiment in vim-like MIDI editing
- an alternative to MuseScore
- no silent mutations when you open a MIDI file
- open source & cross-platform

## todo
- recover previous features
    - try to do necessary edits
- handle all msgs
- horizontal scale shouldn't change when ticks per quarter does
- indicator that more notes are off-screen
- quantization
- mouse
    - drag view
    - mouse wheel zoom
    - click select note
